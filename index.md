## Roadmap

*Achieve before 2019*

### 1. Metacognition

I personally feel that I haven't been taught to think properly, nor I have learned by experience. The This was the most important discovery of myself, and it is a field I definitely want to target for improvement.

### 2. Bio

I should introduce myself, not as a person, but some background as a basis for my posts. I am planning to keep out personal and exact information, but I am certain about including my perfect state of Clarity.

### 3. Fear

I already have a half progress about fear and freedom collected, so that is going to be the third milestone to hit this year.



Let's hope I am going to complete them all. ;)
