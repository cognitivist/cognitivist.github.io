### Warm welcome dear visitor!

It's me, in a form of words.

My thoughts on things.

This website is also meant to represent me, time to time, because conscience and our mind is not a static thing.

I may sound profound or smartass sometimes. I don't want to. First and foremost, I am just collecting my thoughts while making it available for You too. If it makes You think about something, provides progress somehow, then it is already worth for the effort. 

You can be everything, the smartest kid in your primary school class, the most humble one in the high school, a procrastinating university student, a shop assistant, a hand worker or a bored night owl hunting for some life changing miracle alike content on the internet... 

Or nothing, an executing robot processing my site for valuable data.

You can be my best friend, or You can consider yourself my greatest enemy.

That is, have fun on this site and don't hesitate to mail me or expand our knowledge with your valuable thoughts through the comment section.

N.
